Min Prereq: Chapter 8

Customer description:

We tested file system performance using sysbench, and we'd like to understand
what the limiting factor is. The commands we used were:

sysbench --num-threads=1 --test=fileio --file-total-size=2G --file-test-mode=rndrd prepare
sysbench --num-threads=1 --max-requests=1000000 --test=fileio --file-total-size=2G --file-test-mode=rndrd run

You may need to install sysbench first: pkgin in sysbench

Can you explain what is limiting performance of the "run" stage? (It can be rerun
multiple times after prepare has completed, and, the file system cache is warm.)
