Min Prereq: Chapter 8

Customer description:

File system performance is tested using sysbench. The prepare and run commands
are:

sysbench --num-threads=1 --test=fileio --file-total-size=2G --file-test-mode=rndrd prepare
sysbench --num-threads=1 --max-requests=1000000 --test=fileio --file-total-size=2G --file-test-mode=rndrd run

(You may need to install sysbench first: pkgin in sysbench)

Ramp the load by increasing the num-threads from 1 to 10 (or more). Once a limit
has been found, perform Active Bencmarking to determine the limiter. Eg, you can
start with the USE Method.
