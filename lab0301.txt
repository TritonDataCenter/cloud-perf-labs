Customer description:

During CPU profiling of the kernel, the following stack was seen:

              unix`tsc_scalehrtime+0x5a
              unix`disp_getbest+0x167
              unix`disp_getwork+0x2a5
              unix`idle+0x55
              unix`thread_start+0x8

Explain what what this is doing. You can use http://src.illumos.org
as a reference for kernel symbols.
