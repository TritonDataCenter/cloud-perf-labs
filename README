Cloud Performance Labs
----------------------

This is a set of labs, each of which simulate a performance issue for the
student to debug. They are based on the book Systems Performance: Enterprise and
the Cloud, ISBN-10: 0133390098, http://www.brendangregg.com/sysperfbook.html. 

In the top level directory are the lab tickets (*.txt): text files that
simulate a customer ticket. Some of these labs have binaries to execute for
analysis, which have been compiled for SmartOS. The numbering for these is
labCCXX.txt, where CC = chapter number, and XX = lab number.

The source code for the labs is under lab_src. If you are running these to
practice performance analysis, try not to read the source (the answers) until
you are confident you've finished analysis. The labs themselves are intended
to exhibit a single performance issue (or not) in an infinite loop: so you
can run them and leave them running while you perform analysis, then kill
the process once you're done.

These labs have been used during Joyent's Cloud Performance class, run by
Brendan Gregg:
